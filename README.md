## Introduction 

In a context of global population growing older, designing smart homes equipped with a domotic system would enable elder people to live more comfortably and securely at home ; but also the doctor to look after their activities and thus their health at distance.
Collecting data from sensors is easy, but understanding this raw data is complex. Thus it is necessary to have a visualization tool to be able to read, understand and analyse the collected data.

We have created a web platform to visualize and analyze such data.
It was designed for medical staff as well as the patient himself and his family.

It can be used with all devices (computer, tablet, mobile phone), and in most famous browsers : Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox.

## User guide

The system is composed of three roles of user - **Patient/relatives**, **Medical staff**, and **Administrator**. Each role has different privilege to access contents. See more details on [wiki](https://github.com/lvarayut/S5/wiki/User-Guide) page.

## Developer guide

Developer guide describes clearly the procedure of **installation**, **Architecture**, and **Back-end site**. These should be very useful for developer to understand comprehensively in our system before improving it. See more details on [wiki](https://github.com/lvarayut/S5/wiki/Developer-Guide) page.

**Note:** Developer should understand the basic of [Symfony2](http://symfony.com) and the concept of [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) in order to be able to develop efficiently. 

## Further Development

We have planed to develop a lot of features that could make our system nicer, however, some of them cannot be done due to the limited of time. Therefore, all the features are listed here, on [wiki](https://github.com/lvarayut/S5/wiki/Further-Development),  to be a guideline for developer.
