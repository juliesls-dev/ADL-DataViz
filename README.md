### Introduction 

In a context of global population growing older, designing smart homes equipped with a domotic system would enable elder people to live more comfortably and securely at home ; but also the doctor to look after their activities and thus their health at distance.
Collecting data from sensors is easy, but understanding this raw data is complex. Thus it is necessary to have a visualization tool to be able to read, understand and analyse the collected data.

We have created a web platform to visualize and analyze such data.
It was designed for medical staff as well as the patient himself and his family.

It can be used with all devices (computer, tablet, mobile phone), and in most browsers : Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox.
